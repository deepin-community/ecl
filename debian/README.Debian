The libecl.so file is changing too quickly and
is integrated with the ecl binary to such extend
that, after consultation with upstream,  I will 
not create a libecl package.

If ecl will reach a stable release (1.0 or so) and
some guarantees with respect to API stability 
can be make I will reconsider this decision.
